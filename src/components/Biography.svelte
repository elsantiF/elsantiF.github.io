    <h1 class="title">A brief Biography</h1>
    <h3 class="text">
        I was born in Paysand√∫ in the 2001, from my childhood I showed some interests in computers and electronics, possibly instilled by my uncle. 
        At the age of 8 (or 9, I don't remember) I started to write little programs in Python and games in Scratch. 
        And at 14, I made my "biggest" project at that moment, a little 2D clone of Minecraft written in Java with LWJGL and OpenGL 2.1, 
        a couple of years later I started to write more complex programs, some OS developing, Android apps and web pages.
        Now I'm 20, I'm studying at UTEC university in Fray Bentos and started to look a first job to gain more experience.
